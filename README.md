# InteriaGenerator

Necessity is the mother of invention, they say. During my time at Interia, I encountered a module for conducting live text coverage that did not address the needs of journalists covering speedway. We had to manually input race lineups. It wasn't a difficult task, but it was tiresome and irritating. That's why I created a simple generator with graphical interface written in PyQt. After entering the lineups and selecting the type of competition, it generated txt file with all the elements necessary to conduct the coverage.

## Setup

No need to do anything with the code. Just enter "output" folder and download exe file.

## Usage

Enter the riders in the empty fields, choose the template to generate the "match programme" and generate your file!
